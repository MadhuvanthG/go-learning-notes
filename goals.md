### What it is
- Introduce Golang to you
- Possibly provide impetus (or give a head-start) to learn the language 
- Introduce concepts, so you can draw parallels with a language you already know and that would possibly lead to interest in picking up Golang
- Share good resources/ways for learning
- Point out best practices / common conventions in Go

### What it is not
- A step-by-step tutorials. Concepts will be “introduced” with examples but we may not cover all the nuances/gotchas 
- Basics of programming
- A deep dive into one particular concept in Golang. But we won’t stop with just “naming” the concepts either, we will go deep enough

### Applications that I'll switching between
- VS Code
- Terminal - to see output
- Chrome
